# TheStockChange is an app designed for users to view, select, and monitor top-performing stocks over a period of time.
Users can choose from a list of 50 top-performing stocks, and see the percentage change of the stock's price over 1 day, 5 days, or 30 days.
Users can add a selected stock from the Top-Performing stocks tab to their Wish List by tapping the star to quickly access a particular stock when opening up the application.
Users can remove a selected stock from their Wish List by tapping the blue star if they no longer want to easily access the stock.
